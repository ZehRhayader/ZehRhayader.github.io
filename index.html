                <p>British Bangladeshi Poetry Collective (BBPC) is a circle of poets, who nurtures unadulterated passion for poetry in all forms. This club consist of British Bangladeshi origin writing poetry in the U.K. We have cluster of poets who knits words in English and in Bangla. Some poets are bilingual, and they skillfully weave words in both the languages. Poets born in Bangladesh with sentiments and concerns still rooted there and poets born in this very English soil ruminating on life here- both came under this beautiful umbrella to celebrate poetry. BBPC has been performing in various cultural hubs in London since 2016. Among many, poetry reading at Parasol art gallery, Convent garden poetry cafe, Richmix cultural centre, weaver's field art hub were a handful of performances, which earned good name. BBPC has published "British Bangladeshi Poetry An Anthology" a collection of poetry consist of 14 British Bangladeshi poets living in England (edited by poet Shamim Azad and Stephen Watts) in 2017. We hope to expand links between British and Bangladeshi poets through the performance and hope to make more poets in the community aware of this wonderful platform of poetry at a time when global pressures threaten creativity. </p>
